  "summary": "The foundational application structure, including HTML, CSS, and main JavaScript, has been established. Robust `DataStore` and `FilterStore` modules are implemented, providing local storage persistence and a centralized state management mechanism with subscription capabilities. A `MarkdownRenderer` utility with basic markdown-to-HTML conversion and accompanying GitHub-like styling is in place. The core `Notes` module has been built, integrating with `DataStore` and `FilterStore` to manage a list of notes, a markdown editor, and a live side-by-side preview. It observes filter changes to display relevant notes. Basic unit tests have been implemented for `DataStore`, `FilterStore`, and `MarkdownRenderer`. The application's styling adheres to initial Swiss design principles, focusing on clean typography, white space, and a muted palette.",

  "knownIssues": [
    "The note filtering logic within `src/app/notes/notes.js` needs to be thoroughly verified to ensure it correctly applies both `searchQuery` and `tagIds` from the `FilterStore` to the displayed notes. While observation is set up, the exact filtering implementation details for complex scenarios might need refinement.",
    "The Swiss design principles (e.g., specific typography weights, exact spacing, interactive states, subtle animations) have been initiated but will require a detailed visual review and potential CSS adjustments to meet the full aesthetic requirements.",
    "Error handling for `DataStore` operations (e.g., localStorage full, malformed data) is basic and could be made more robust.",
    "The application structure is set up, but the integration and display of sibling modules like `/app/tags` and `/app/search` are not yet part of the main `app.js` layout or `notes.js` functionality. The current UI primarily focuses on the note list and editor."
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Conduct a manual verification of `src/app/notes/notes.js` to confirm that note creation, editing, deletion, selection, and the live preview function as expected and persist correctly via `DataStore`.",
    "Thoroughly test the filtering mechanism in `src/app/notes/notes.js` by setting various search queries and tag filters via the `FilterStore` (manually or through a temporary UI) and verifying that the correct subset of notes is displayed.",
    "Perform a comprehensive visual review of the application against the 'Swiss design' principles, making any necessary adjustments to `src/app/app.css` and `src/app/notes/notes.css` to refine typography, spacing, borders, and color palette.",
    "Implement a basic UI for adding new notes and a clear mechanism for deleting selected notes within the `notes` module, if not fully present or intuitive.",
    "Add a temporary debugging UI or console logging to `app.js` or `notes.js` to easily inspect the state of `DataStore` and `FilterStore` during manual testing."
