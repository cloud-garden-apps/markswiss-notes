  "summary": "The worker has made substantial progress on the core functionality. The `DataStore` module has been initialized and partially implemented with basic note persistence mechanisms. The `FilterStore` is set up to manage search queries and active tags, including a subscription mechanism. The `NotesModule` is the most developed, featuring imports for data and filters, a constructor that initializes UI elements (note list, editor, preview), basic rendering, and event listeners for editor input. CRUD operations within the `NotesModule` are partially implemented, with create, read (list display), and update (editor sync) showing some functionality, though not fully connected to the `DataStore` or properly handling all UI states.",

    "src/filters/filter-store.js",
    "src/notes/notes.js"
  ],
  "knownIssues": [
    "Full CRUD operations are not completed in `DataStore`. Specifically, methods for updating, deleting, and comprehensively retrieving notes (beyond initial load) are missing or incomplete. Tag management methods are entirely missing.",
    "The `DataStore` doesn't notify subscribers of changes, which is crucial for the UI to react to data updates.",
    "The `FilterStore` is missing concrete methods to `setSearchQuery`, `addTag`, `removeTag`, `clearFilters`, and `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` fully.",
    "In `NotesModule`, the note list rendering is basic and doesn't fully react to data changes from `DataStore` or filter changes from `FilterStore`. Filtering logic based on `FilterStore` state is not implemented.",
    "Note selection, editing, saving, and deletion functionalities within the UI (in `NotesModule`) are not fully wired up to the `DataStore` and lack complete state management for active notes.",
    "New note creation and persistent saving is not fully functional, and updating existing notes is not saving changes back to `DataStore`.",
    "The UI lacks complete styling and error handling. The overall application layout is not defined in `/app` (implied by context, not explicitly in the module files).",
    "The provided `DataStore` and `FilterStore` snippets end abruptly, suggesting methods are not fully written or closed out."
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Complete all CRUD methods in `src/data-store/data-store.js` for notes (e.g., `saveNote`, `updateNote`, `deleteNote`, `getNoteById`, `getAllNotes`). Implement tag management (create, delete, getAllTags) as per the module's responsibility. Add a publish-subscribe mechanism to `DataStore` to notify listeners of data changes.",
    "Complete all methods in `src/filters/filter-store.js` for managing search queries (`setSearchQuery`) and active tags (`addTag`, `removeTag`, `clearFilters`). Ensure `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` methods are fully implemented.",
    "In `src/notes/notes.js`, implement the logic to subscribe to `DataStore` changes and `FilterStore` changes. Re-render the note list and update the editor/preview whenever relevant data or filter states change.",
    "Implement the `_applyFilters` method in `src/notes/notes.js` to correctly filter notes based on `FilterStore`'s `searchQuery` and `activeTags` before displaying them.",
    "Refine `NotesModule` UI logic: complete note selection handling (highlighting, loading content into editor), implement 'New Note' functionality, ensure note content changes in the editor are saved back to `DataStore` (on debounce or blur), and wire up 'Delete Note' functionality.",
    "Add basic error handling and UI feedback for CRUD operations where applicable."
