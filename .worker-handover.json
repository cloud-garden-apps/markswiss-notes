  "status": "incomplete",
  "summary": "The foundational structure for the note-taking application has been established, including the `DataStore` for persistent storage, the `FilterStore` for managing search and tag filters, and the `NotesModule` which houses the core UI for note display, editing, and preview. The `NotesModule` has been initialized with basic HTML structure for the note list, editor, and preview, and event listeners for creating new notes, deleting notes, selecting notes, and typing in the editor are in place. Subscriptions to both `DataStore` and `FilterStore` are set up, allowing the `NotesModule` to react to data and filter changes, but the filtering logic itself and the full implementation of CRUD operations within `NotesModule` are not yet complete.",

  ],
  "knownIssues": [
    "CRUD operations (Create, Update, Delete) are not fully integrated between `NotesModule` and `DataStore`. Specifically, creating a new note, deleting a note, and updating note content from the editor are not completely wired up.",
    "The filtering logic in `NotesModule._filterNotes` is incomplete; it currently only initializes, but does not perform actual filtering based on `searchQuery` and `activeTags` from `FilterStore`.",
    "Selecting a note from the list does not yet correctly load its content into the editor or preview, and the visual indication of the selected note is missing.",
    "The initial rendering of notes from `DataStore` into the note list is not fully functional, and new notes don't immediately appear or become selectable.",
    "The `index.html` file is still a skeleton; the `NotesModule` needs to be initialized and appended to the DOM.",
    "The 'marked' library is imported in `index.html` but not yet fully utilized within `NotesModule` for rendering markdown in the preview."
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Implement the `_handleNewNote` method in `NotesModule` to call `dataStore.addNote`, and then select the newly created note.",
    "Complete the `_handleDeleteNote` method in `NotesModule` to call `dataStore.deleteNote` for the `selectedNoteId`.",
    "Finalize the `_handleEditorInput` method to ensure that on every input, `dataStore.updateNote` is called with the current content, title, and selected note ID.",
    "Flesh out the `_handleNoteSelection` method in `NotesModule` to retrieve the selected note's data from `dataStore`, update `selectedNoteId`, and render its content in the editor and preview.",
    "Implement the full filtering logic within `NotesModule._filterNotes` to apply both `searchQuery` and `activeTags` from `FilterStore` to the `notes` array before rendering.",
    "Ensure `NotesModule._renderNotesList` correctly marks the currently `selectedNoteId` with an active style.",
    "Integrate the `marked` library in `NotesModule._renderPreview` to convert markdown content to HTML.",
    "Instantiate `NotesModule` in `index.html` and append its main element to the document body to make the UI visible and functional."
