  "summary": "The worker has established the foundational application structure, including the `DataStore` for note persistence, the `FilterStore` for managing search and tags, and the `NotesModule` for the user interface. Significant progress has been made on the `NotesModule`, with UI elements for the note list, editor, and preview initialized, along with basic rendering and event listeners for editor input. However, the critical integration between the `NotesModule`'s CRUD operations and the `DataStore` is incomplete, and the filtering logic in `NotesModule` to react to `FilterStore` changes needs full implementation.",

  ],
  "knownIssues": [
    "The `DataStore` module is missing or has incomplete implementations for methods to add, update, and delete notes.",
    "The `NotesModule`'s create, update, and delete operations are not fully connected to the `DataStore` to ensure persistence and data synchronization.",
    "The `NotesModule` does not fully implement the logic to observe and react to `FilterStore` changes, meaning notes are not filtered by search query or active tags.",
    "The side-by-side preview might not be fully functional or correctly display markdown content for all note states due to incomplete data flow.",
    "The UI for selecting an existing note, and updating its content via the editor, is not fully robust or error-handled.",
    "Unique ID generation for new notes within `DataStore` needs verification.",
    "Error handling for localStorage operations in `DataStore` is likely missing."
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Implement the `addNote`, `updateNote`, and `deleteNote` methods in `src/data-store/data-store.js`, ensuring they interact correctly with `localStorage` and notify subscribers.",
    "Refactor the `NotesModule`'s `_handleNewNote` method to correctly call `DataStore.addNote` and then re-render the notes list.",
    "Refactor the `NotesModule`'s `_handleEditorInput` and `_handleNoteSelection` methods to correctly call `DataStore.updateNote` when a note's content changes.",
    "Implement the `NotesModule`'s `_handleDeleteNote` method to call `DataStore.deleteNote` for the currently selected note and update the UI.",
    "Implement the filtering logic within `NotesModule`'s `renderNotes` or a dedicated filtering method to use `FilterStore`'s `searchQuery` and `activeTags` to display only relevant notes.",
    "Ensure the `NotesModule` correctly subscribes to `FilterStore` and re-renders notes when filter state changes.",
    "Verify that the live side-by-side markdown preview correctly updates as the user types in the editor for the currently selected note.",
    "Add basic error handling and UI feedback for CRUD operations.",
    "Review and ensure the unique ID generation logic for notes is robust."
